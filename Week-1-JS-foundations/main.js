// Interpreted Language JS


console.log("Hello, World!");
// This is a simple JavaScript program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

console.log(a)

// The variable 'a' is not defined, so this will throw a ReferenceError.
// Program will run Hello, World! but will throw an error for the next line.
// Thus JS is not a compiled language, it is an interpreted language.
